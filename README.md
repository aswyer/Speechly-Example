# Speechly-Example

A simple project to show how [Speechly](https://www.speechly.com/) can be implemented into a Swift based app. 

Tap & hold the mic button to ask a question or to perform an action. This example is based around sports (soccer, football, running, etc.) and teams (currently US states: Virginia, Georgia, Arizona, etc.). Your voice request can be similar to these "intents":

1. Follow a Team: _"follow georgia sports"_
2. See the News: _"football news for georgia"_
3. Check the Score: _"what is the score for georgia football?"_

Checkout [config_reference.txt](config_reference.txt) which helps train Speechly models for our specific application. Learn how this file was written [here](https://docs.speechly.com/slu-examples/basics/).
